# Tutorial: AgentLock

AgentLock is a security platform that protects **AI Agents** by replacing traditional passwords with strict **cryptographic identities** (Ed25519). Instead of blindly trusting an agent, the system uses a **Machine Learning** brain to continuously analyze behavior—such as the time of day or action frequency—to calculate a dynamic *Trust Score*. If an agent acts suspiciously, their score drops, and the system automatically blocks them from performing sensitive tasks.
