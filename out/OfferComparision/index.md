# Tutorial: OfferComparision

**OfferComparison** is an intelligent engine that helps job seekers evaluate offers beyond just the gross salary. It functions as a **workflow pipeline** that standardizes job titles, calculates *real-world purchasing power* (after taxes and cost of living), and scores offers based on personal preferences. Finally, it uses **Artificial Intelligence** to generate negotiation advice and presents everything in an *interactive visual dashboard*.
